In order to bootstrap after first checkout

Install the PuskOK GIT SCC proxy http://www.pushok.com/software/git.html

Check out with external git tool

After checkout, uncheck read-only for the entire repository

1. Open the workspace
   It will complain in cannot open the target, this is OK

2. Fix the SCC settings
   Right Click on the Workspace
   Go to Properties
   Go to Source Control
   Select PushOK GITSCC as the Source Control System
   The Local Root Directory should be on the project folder (e.g. "pbunit") not in "src"
   Click Connect

3. Close the Workspace
   ORCAscript will fail if it is open

4. Fix scripts\bootstrap.orca with your information:
   SCC get connect properties "C:\kode\powerunit\src\pbunit.pbw"
   SCC set connect property userid "alarsen.cap@gmail.com"

5. Run the bootstrap script
   if orcascr125.exe is on your system path, just run scripts/bootstrap.cmd
   if not, find orcascr125.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Sybase\Shared\PowerBuilder
   and use bootstrap.orca

6. Open the Workspace and add the target "pbunitgui.pbt"
   It might complain about not beeing checked out, just hit OK

7. Get latest from repository
   Right click the target
   Get latest
   Select multiple files contained in this target
   Select all

The Workspace and IDE is now in a state you can work with!
