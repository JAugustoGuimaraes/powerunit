In order to bootstrap after first checkout

Install the PuskOK GIT SCC proxy http://www.pushok.com/software/git.html

After checkout, uncheck read-only for the entire repository

1. Open the workspace
   It will complain in cannot open the target, this is OK

2. Fix the SCC settings
   Right Click on the Workspace
   Go to Properties
   Go to Source Control
   Select PushOK GITSCC as the Source Control System
   The Local Root Directory should be on the project folder (e.g. "pbunit") not in "src"
   Click Connect

3. Close the Workspace
   ORCAscript will fail if it is open

4. Fix bootstrap.orca with your information:
   SCC get connect properties "C:\kode\powerunit\pbunit.pbw"
   SCC set connect property userid "alarsen.cap@gmail.com"

5. Run it with orcascr125.exe
